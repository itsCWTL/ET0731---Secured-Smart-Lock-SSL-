Brief concept: In order to ensure that users can easily unlock their Secured Smart Lock (SSL) securely, we have implemented a number of security features and wireless technologies which are either performed behind the scenes, or when it requires user's inputs, is easy for them to use. Never undermine the harderend security that Se cured Smart Lock is able to provide. Using a combination of self-developed 128-bit AES CBC encryption algorithm to secure data, our smart lock also takes advantage of multi-factor authentication which includes features like biometric authentication and other important security implementations like destruction of useless data and session management. All will be discussed in the report and presentation slides that our team has constructed to discuss the security implementations in detail, as well as Google sites to market and demonstrate the Secured Smart Lock (SSL). Accompanying all of these are our self-developed codes of the Arduino's ESP32,keypad and stepper motor which function as the lock mechanism built into our prototype enclosure, as well as the Java code for our Android application which will help users unlock their door. <br><br>
